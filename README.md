To work with the bot, follow the link 'https://t.me/aefioiefjsrhfbsbjbot'.

If you call '/start' or '/help' you will see instructions how to use it. 

You can find code for bot in 'main.js'. It requires all files from './modules'. I also use file './base/getAllData.js' to refresh all information: group names, schedule for student and teachers etc. All this information is hold in './base'.
